                <p>Pizza is one of the most popular food options for Americans, with 350 slices eaten by the second. To
                    put
                    that in perspective, about 21,000 slices are eaten nationally in just one minute.
                    One of the biggest days for pizzerias around the country is Super Bowl Sunday. Pizza is a major
                    staple
                    to this sports event, with an average of 2,500,000 pizzas being sold just from Pizza Hut alone.
                    Historians from the William E. Macaulay Honors College discovered that the poorer people of Naples
                    would
                    put slices of tomatoes on dough and top it with cheese to make a cheap and easy meal for their
                    families.<br> According to the researchers, tomatoes were thought to be poisonous during these days,
                    which is why pizza was considered a cheaper food.

               <p style="color: black;" > <strong> (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a savory dish of Italian origin, consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (anchovies, olives, meat, etc.) baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1] A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta.

                In Italy, pizza served in formal settings, such as at a restaurant, is presented unsliced and eaten with the use of a knife and fork.[2][3] In casual settings it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand.
                
                The term pizza was first recorded in the 10th century in a Latin manuscript from the Southern Italian town of Gaeta in Lazio, on the border with Campania.[4] Modern pizza was invented in Naples, and the dish and its variants have since become popular in many countries.[5] It has become one of the most popular foods in the world and a common fast food item in Europe and North America,
                 available at pizzerias (restaurants specializing in pizza), restaurants offering Mediterranean cuisine, and via pizza delivery.[5][6] Many companies sell ready-baked frozen pizzas to be reheated in an ordinary home oven. </strong></p>

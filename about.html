         <p>Pizza is one of the most popular food options for Americans, with 350 slices eaten by the second. To put that in perspective, about 21,000 slices are eaten nationally in just one minute.
            One of the biggest days for pizzerias around the country is Super Bowl Sunday. Pizza is a major staple to this sports event, with an average of 2,500,000 pizzas being sold just from Pizza Hut alone.
            Historians from the William E. Macaulay Honors College discovered that the poorer people of Naples would put slices of tomatoes on dough and top it with cheese to make a cheap and easy meal for their families.<br> According to the researchers, tomatoes were thought to be poisonous during these days, which is why pizza was considered a cheaper food.
